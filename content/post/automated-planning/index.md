This project investigates the modeling of planning problems using PDDL and HDDL, with planner execution facilitated through planutils [[1]](https://github.com/AI-Planning/planutils) and Panda [[2]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13218-020-00699-y). The implementation progresses from foundational classical planning to temporal planning, culminating in robotic system integration via PlanSys2 [[3]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00376). Key challenges addressed include the modeling of limited resources, multi agent coordination, and compatibility with robotic execution frameworks.
